## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections requested that an election audit is performed on a recent local congressional election. The results of the audit will provide the following information:
1.	How many votes were cast in the congressional election?
2.	A breakdown of the number of votes along with the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
3.	Which county had the largest number of votes?
4.	A breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
5.	Which of the candidates won the election? What was the percentage of votes the winner received and what was the total number of votes the winner received?
## Resources
-	Data Source: election_results.csv
-	Software: Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.53.2
## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
1.	There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
2.	The Counties in the precinct and the total number of votes were:

-	Denver: 82.8% (306,055)
-	Arapahoe: 6.7% (24,801)
3.	The Largest County Turnout was Denver.
4.	The candidates and their results were:
-	Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes
-	Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
-	Raymond Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes

## Election-Audit Summary
The following steps were taken to provide the results of the audit:
1.	Code was created to calculate the total number of votes cast.
2.	Created code to calculate the counties in the precinct and the percent/number of votes each county received.
3.	Calculated the county that had the largest number of turnout.
4.	A complete list of candidates was provided by performing a calculation in code
5.	Calculated the total number of votes each candidate received along with the percentage of votes each candidate won.
6.	The last set of code was written to determine the winner of the election based on votes.

The code can also be modified to show how many votes in how many counties that each candidate received. For example Charles Casper Stockham received 19723 votes in Jefferson, 8302 votes in Arapahoe, and 57188 votes in Denver. In addition, providing a percent of how many votes in how many counties that each candidate received.
