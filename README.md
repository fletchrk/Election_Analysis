# Election_Analysis
## Project Overview
The Colorado Board of Elections requested that an election audit is performed on a recent local congressional election. The results of the audit will provide the following information:
1.	Total number of votes cast
2.	A complete list of candidates who received votes
3.	Total number of votes each candidate received
4.	Percentage of votes each candidate won
5.	The winner of the election based on popular vote
## Resources
-	Data Source: election_results.csv
-	Software: Python 3.7, Visual Studio Code, 1.53.2
## Summary
The analysis of the election show that:
-	There were 369,711 votes cast in the election.
-	The candidates were:
-	Charles Casper Stockham
-	Diana DeGette
-	Raymond Anthony Doane
-	The candidate results were:
-	Charles Casper Stockham received 23.0% of the vote and 85,213 number of votes.
-	Diana DeGette received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
-	Raymond Anthony Doane received 3.1% of the vote and 11,606 number of votes.
-	The winner of the election was:
-	Diana DeGette, who received 73.8% of the vote and 272,892 number of votes.
## Challenge Overview
The following steps were taken to provide the results of the audit:
1.	Code was created to calculate the total number of votes cast.
2.	A complete list of candidates was provided by doing code
3.	Calculated the total number of votes each candidate received along with the percentage of votes each candidate won.
4.	The last set of code was written to determine the winner of the election based on votes.
## Challenge Summary
Using mostly Visual Studio Code, code was written step-by-step to get accurate answers. Each of the tasks was done separately then at the end the code was summarized in a text file.
